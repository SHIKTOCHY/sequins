# This configuration file is in toml format, which is defined here:
# https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

# Unless specified otherwise, the below values are the defaults.

root = "hdfs://namenode:8020/path/to/sequins"
# The url or directory where the sequencefiles are. This can be a local
# directory, an HDFS url of the form hdfs://<namenode>:<port>/path/to/stuff,
# or an S3 url of the form s3://<bucket>/path/to/stuff. This should be a
# a directory of directories of directories; each first level represents a 'db',
# and each subdirectory therein represents a 'version' of that db. See the
# README for more information. This must be set.

# bind = "0.0.0.0:9599"
# The address to bind on.

# local_store = "/var/sequins/"
# This is where sequins will store its internal copy of all the data it ingests.

# require_success_file = false
# If this flag is set, sequins will only ingest data from directories that have
# a _SUCCESS file (which is produced by hadoop when it completes a job).

# refresh_period = "10m"
# If this is specified, sequins will periodically download new data this often
# (in seconds). This is disabled by default. If you enable it, you should also
# enable 'require_success_file', or sequins may start automatically downloading
# a partially-created set of files.

# content_type = "application/json"
# If this is set, sequins will set this Content-Type header on responses. By
# default, no content type is specified.

# You can define one of these blocks in order to override settings for one
# specific db (the name must match the name of the subdirectory under root):

# [dbs.foo]
# content_type = "image/png"
# refresh_period = "10s"

[s3]

# The S3 region for the bucket where your data is. If unset (the default), and
# sequins is running on EC2, this will be set to the instance region.
# region = "us-west-1"

# The access key and secret to use for S3. If unset (the default), the env
# variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY will be used, or IAM
# instance role credentials if they are available.
# access_key_id = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
# secret_access_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"

[zk]

# If this is set, sequins will connect to zookeeper at the given addresses and
# try to join the existing cluster. This is disabled by default.
# servers = ["localhost:2181"]

# This defines the root prefix to use for zookeeper state. If you are running
# multiple sequins clusters using the same zookeeper for coordination, you
# should change this so they can't conflict.
# prefix = "/sequins"

# Upon startup, sequins will wait this long for the set of known peers to
# stabilize.
# time_to_converge = "10s"

# This is the total timeout (connect + request) for proxied requests to peers
# in a sequins cluster. You may want to increase this if you're running on
# particularly cold storage, or if there are other factors significantly
# increasing request time.
# proxy_timeout = "100ms"

# This is the hostname sequins uses to advertise itself to peers in a cluster.
# It should be resolvable by those peers. If left unset (the default), it will
# be set to the hostname of the server.
# advertised_hostname = "example.com"
