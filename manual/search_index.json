We need\nto give it some.Writing some dataSequins works by asynchronously mirroring data at rest in HDFS, S3, or another\nfilesystem. It's particularly suited for ingesting data written from\nHadoop or similar tools.You'll want to write a job that dumps out some key/value-oriented data in the\nSequenceFile format. This is a commonly-used format in the\nHadoop ecosystem, so tools like Pig, Scalding or Spark should all be able to\nwrite it out of the box. More info on the supported formats can be found in the\nData Requirements section.Once you have your data ready, you need to arrange it in a particular way in\nS3, HDFS, or on local disk2:/path/to/data\n└── mydata\n    └── version0\n        ├── part-00000  # These names are irrelevant, but this is how Hadoop\n        ├── part-00001  # names files.\n        ├── part-00002\n        └── ...\nmydata is a name for your dataset, which we'll henceforth call a database.\nversion0 is the version of the database; that comes into play when we want\nto update it.

If it's\na large dataset, this can take a while. (If it's a really big dataset, you'll\nwant to read about sharding over multiple\nmachines.)You can check the progress by opening http://localhost:9599 in a browser, or\nsimply watching the logs.Querying itOnce your data is finished loading, you can query it by issuing an HTTP GET to\n//:$ http localhost:9599//\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 7\nDate: Mon, 01 Aug 2016 11:57:53 GMT\nLast-Modified: Mon, 01 Aug 2016 11:56:27 GMT\nX-Sequins-Version: version0\n\n\nFurther ConfigurationSequins usually reads its config from a configuration file called\nsequins.conf, either in the local directory or at /etc/sequins.conf.The release tarballs contain a sequins.conf.example, which you can copy and\nmodify as you please; you can also check out the Configuration\nReference for more details.\n1.

When sequins starts up, and whenever it is told to refresh its local data,\nit will do its best to mirror the organizational structure of the source root.This source root can be on local disk, HDFS, or Amazon S3.

Sequins treats prefix components separated by / as directories,\njust like awscli or other tools.Under the source root, the data should be organized into databases and below\nthat into versions:/path/to/data\n├── \n│   ├── \n│   │   ├── \n│   │   ├── \n│   │   ├── \n│   │   └── ...\n│   └── \n│       └── ...\n└── \n    └── \n        └── ...\nBoth the database and version can be arbitrary strings, but URI-friendly strings\nare recommended.Databases and VersionsA single sequins instance can hold multiple databases. This is the first layer of\ndirectories in the source root.Sequins doesn't support individual writes, like other object stores would.\nInstead, databases are versioned. To update a database, you present it with an\nentirely new copy of the dataset, called a version, by dropping it into the\ndatabase folder in the source root.Database and version names are just arbitrary strings, and are compared\nlexicographically - so to update a database, you need to give it a version that\nis lexicographically greater than the current one. At Stripe we use date\n+%Y%m%d (eg 20160901) and timestamps.Sequins will load this in the background and hotswap it in atomically.\nAdditionally, Sequins returns an X-Sequins-Version header on\nresponses if\nyou need to track what version you're getting.Loading New DataYou can tell sequins to check for new data in two ways. The first is the\nrefresh_period\nconfiguration property, which instructs sequins to continually check for new\ndata. You can also send a SIGHUP to the process and it will reload a single\ntime.Either way, sequins will perform three operations:For any new databases that weren't there before, load the latest version and\nstart serving it.\nFor each database which is no longer in the source root, stop serving it and\ndelete it locally.\nFor each existing database, load whichever version is lexicographically\ngreatest, if it is not the current local version.\n"},"1-2-data-requirements/":{"url":"1-2-data-requirements/","title":"Data Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Data RequirementsCurrently sequins only supports one input file format:\nSequenceFile.

Sequins will\nautomatically and transparently divvy up and replicate your data, but this\ncomes with two important caveats:Sequins sharding is static. A cluster will reshard a database once at\nstartup, and once whenever a new version is available.\nNew nodes will happily overreplicate partitions, but if a node disappears\nthe cluster will never automatically re-replicate partitions (you can,\nhowever, replace the node).\nSequins requires a running Zookeeper cluster for coordination, but not to\nserve requests (see Zookeeper Failure for more\ninformation on how this dependency works, and what the failure modes are).Setting upYou'll need the following properties in sequins.conf on all the nodes in the\ncluster, at a minimum:sharding.enabled: This should be set to true.\nzk.servers: This should be the address(es) of the zookeeper quorum, eg\n[\"zk1:2181\"]\nThere's lots of other ways to tweak your distributed setup; see the\nConfiguration Reference for details.Then start up the nodes. Because sharding is static, sequins will wait for the\nlist of peers to stabilize before proceeding; you should start the nodes at\nroughly the same time, or some partitions will be overreplicated.That's it! Once the data is ingested, you can query any node in the cluster for\nany key; peers will transparently proxy to eachother.Node FailureBy default, sequins has a sharding.replication setting of 2. That means that\nin the face of a single node going down, the cluster should still be able to\nrespond to all requests1.However, as mentioned earlier, sequins sharding is static; it will not\nautomatically correct the underreplication that results from a node\ndisappearing. If a node is permanently down, this can leave you in a precarious\nposition.Sequins provides a mechanism to deal with this in the form of the\nshard_id configuration\nproperty. The shard_id, unlike hostname, does not have to be unique per node.\nIf you spin up a node with the same shard_id, it will replicate the exact same\npartitions. You can use this to replace an exploded node, or to spin up a new\nnode in advance of decommissioning an old one.\n1. Of course, it's still important for clients to retry requests (and have timeouts). ↩\n\nZookeeper FailureSequins depends on Zookeeper for the coordination of sharding, but only ever\nasynchronously. That means that if Zookeeper becomes unavailable,New nodes will refuse to start up.\nSequins will not download new databases or versions of databases.\nIn the case of a split, where some nodes can talk to Zookeeper and others\ncan not, the partition map may become stale, and you may receive different\nversions of a given database from different nodes.\nCrucially, however, Zookeeper going down should never impact an existing\ncluster's ability to service requests.Version Consistency Around UpgradesNodes in a sequins cluster will make a best-effort attempt to upgrade a given\ndatabase at more or less the same time. It is, of course, physically impossible\nto ensure that individual nodes upgrade exactly at the same time, and you should\nnot rely on this property.Individual nodes will also attempt to be individually consistent. If you query a\nnode in sequence, you should only ever see the version monotonically increase;\nin other words, once a node has upgraded to a new version of a given database,\nit should never return values from an older version, even if that request was\nproxied to another node. This, however, is also best-effort, and can fail in\nthe case of extended coordination failure (because of a Zookeeper outage or\nsomething else).In these cases, Sequins will always optimize for availability, and choose to\nreturn a value from a different version if that is the only value available.\nSequins returns an X-Sequins-Version header on\nresponses if you\nneed to track what version you're getting."},"1-5-healthchecks-and-monitoring/":{"url":"1-5-healthchecks-and-monitoring/","title":"Healthchecks and Monitoring","keywords":"","body":"Healthchecks and MonitoringThe Status Page and JSONVisiting the host and port that a sequins node is running on with your browser\nwill give you a simple status page with sharding and version information for\neach database:The information presented represents the whole cluster in the distributed case,\nand should be the same no matter which node you ask.

In production at Stripe, on AWS instances with SSDs,\nwe see a 50th percentile latency of about 500µs and a 99th percentile latency of\nabout 2-3ms, and we've run loadtests up to about 20k requests a second. If\nyou're getting significantly worse performance than that, please let us\nknow.That said, there are a few tweaks available to improve load times and reduce\nlatency in some specific circumstances.Pre-shard Your DataSequins uses a sharding algorithm in which keys are\nbucket into N partitions, where the number of partitions is the number of files\nin the dataset. To do this, it uses a hash function based on hashCode\nfunction, chosen because it aligns coincidentally with the way Hadoop buckets\nkeys into reducers.In practice, this means that if your Hadoop job outputting the data has a reduce\nstep, and the key is the same as the output key, then your data is\neffectively pre-sharded when it's written out, and each individual sequins\ninstance can just download the data it needs, rather scanning everything and\ndownloading just the keys it wants.While this obviously isn't a hard requirement, it can make loading new data much\nfaster.Throttle Loads to Reduce the Impact on LatencyIf you're constantly loading new data to a cluster, you may see that adversely\nimpact latency. On small instances, data loads can thrash the disk or network,\ncausing requests to drop or get timed out.Sequins has a couple configuration settings designed to mitigate this. First,\nsetting max_parallel_loads to\na low number will effectively queue loads for different databases.Second, the throttle_loads\nproperty lets you significantly slow down every database load, by injecting\nsleeps into the process. Used carefully, this can let you amortize the loading\ncost over the period until your next write is ready.Tweak Proxy Timeoutsproxy_timeout and\nproxy_stage_timeout let\nyou tweak the \"backup request\" strategy for proxied requests in a distributed\ncluster.The defaults, however, are intentionally set high.

For an overview of\nrunning a sequins cluster, including notes on how it should behave, see Running\nA Distributed Cluster.The algorithm described here is effectively isolated between databases.\nTherefore, this document speaks to the operations on a single sequins database,\nrather than everything at once.Design PrinciplesSequins should be able to scale horizontally by just adding nodes to an\nexisting cluster. This should require as little shared state (in Zookeeper)\nas possible, and that shared state should be considered ephemeral.\nSpecifically, sequins should absolutely not require shared state in the read\npath; meaning that any node must be able to continue serving requests without\nany shared state available.\nTo minimize implementation complexity, sharding should be as static as\npossible. A cluster must reshard a database once at startup, and once\nwhenever a new version is available, but should not dynamically correct over-\nor underreplication.\nSince sequins is a more-or-less static, stateless store, and since writes are\nasync and affect the entire database at once, we don't have to think too hard\nabout consistency. But one important property to try to gaurantee is\nmonotonic reads; if you talk to a single sequins instance during a version\nupgrade, you get only records from version (N-1) until the node upgrades, and\nthen only records from version N.\nShared State in ZookeeperZookeeper is used for shared state. To minimize complexity and stay robust to\nZookeeper failure, the code only supports two operations:Publishing ephemeral keys into a znode\n\nListing a znode's children and caching the state locally\n\nAll state must be considered possibly minutes, hours or years stale. All read\noperations read the cache; the syncing process happens separately.All znodes described below are prefixed under a root which includes the cluster\nname and a protocol number\n(currently v1).Properties of a VersionA version is an immutable map of keys to values, existing in the source root as\na collection of N files. Keys can be duplicated in the map, but only one value\nwill be loaded (which one is picked is undefined).In addition, each version is sharded into N partitions. Each partition K\ncontains the keyspace where hashCode(key) % N == K.We use java's hashCode algorithm as the hashing function, and the number of\nfiles as N, because that allows us to treat many datasets as pre-sharded by\nHadoop's shuffle step. In particular, any Hadoop job with the default\nPartitioner will produce a version where each file has the\nkeyspace of one and only one partition.However, this isn't a guarantee, so we treat this only as a possible\noptimization.UpgradesThis is the meatiest part of the distributed algorithm: how nodes discover and\nload new versions.On startup (or when reconnecting to zookeeper), a nodeCreates an ephemeral znode under /nodes for itself\nStarts watching /nodes. On startup, it waits for these to remain stable\nfor some period before\ncontinuing.\nWhen it sees a new version (this also occurs at startup, and applies to both\nexisting and new databases), itWatches the children of partitions/, and continually mirrors that\nstate locally. This is the map of where partitions live on the cluster.\nWaits until every partition represented in the cluster at least once; in\nother words, until the minimum replication factor is at least\n1.\nIn the background, it decides which partitions it is responsible for and\nbackfills them. To do that, itDecides which partitions it is responsible for offline, by:a. Putting all the nodes it knows about, including itself, on a partition\n  ringb. For a given partition, placing that on the partition ring and picking the\n  two (or whatever the replication factor is) nodes closest to that point,\n  counter clockwise.c. If it itself is one of those nodes, then it is responsible for that partition.\nStarts loading and preparing those partitions. As they become available, it\nwrites an ephemeral node to the partition map, at\n/partitions//@.\nNote that the ring is only used as a way to stably, fairly and deterministically\npick partitions without actually needing to read  current state of the cluster\n(which could be racy). Once the partition map is built, that is used as the\nactual state of the cluster going forward.Once a node has the data locally, it can respond to peers that specifically ask\nthat version, but it won't upgrade to clients until it sees that a version is\ncomplete across the cluster. Note that this switch to clients, which is the\nactual upgrade, can happen before or after the local partitions are finished\nloading; it's decoupled from that process. This is important if, for example, a\nnode is starting up to join an existing cluster, and wants to be able to service\nrequests immediately.Even once it does upgrade (again, to clients), it keeps the old version around\nfor a period of time. Specifically, it starts a 10 minute timer, and every time\nit receives a request for the old version, it resets the timer. Only at the end\nof the timer does it clear the old version.That means that a cluster effectively has two versions during an upgrade. In\nthis way, individual nodes can lag behind and still present a consistent picture\nto the clients they talk to.Finally, when responding to a request, the nodeLooks to see if it has the partition of the key locally. If so, it responds immediately\n\nIf not, determines a list of peers by consulting the cache of\n/partitions//\n\nPicks a node at random and tries it (?proxy=true is added to the\nquerystring to indicate that it shouldn't be proxied further).\n\nEvery duration of\nproxy_stage_timeout, it\nstarts a request to a new node in parallel.\n\nReturns the first request that succeeds, or bails after\nproxy_timeout.\n\n"},"x-1-configuration-reference/":{"url":"x-1-configuration-reference/","title":"1.
